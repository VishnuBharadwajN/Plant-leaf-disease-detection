# Plant-leaf-disease-detection
In this project we have created an pretrained leaf disease detection system using deep learning techniques. Plant diseases pose a significant risk to agricultural productivity, and early detection remains a difficult task for farmers due to their similar look in colour, shape, and texture.  Transfer learning is used to fine-tune the previously learned models.

To overcome overfitting, data augmentation techniques like as picture enhancement, rotation, scaling, and translation are used. This research gives a detailed taxonomy of the performance of several pre-trained neural networks in plant leaf disease detection.

        Furthermore, the suggested work's performance is evaluated using a publicly accessible plant village dataset, which consists of 38 classes collected from 14 crops.  The suggested model's performance evaluation shows that it is effective at categorizing various types of plant illnesses.
